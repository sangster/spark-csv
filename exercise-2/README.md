Generate a CSV to use by running:

    $ ruby csv_generator.rb

The `contact_sort.rb` file uses this csv to group and then list contacts by
their group name, sorted alphabetically and then output to HTML.

To run:

    $ ruby contact_sort.rb > results.html

Please refactor the code in this exercise. You don't need to spend any time
improving the look of the html results, this is focused on Ruby.
