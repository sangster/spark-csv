Welcome to the Spark workout of the day!

This repository contains two exercises to complete:

1. Exercise 1 requires you to write your own Ruby code to import contacts.
2. Exercise 2 requires you to refactor existing code to sort contacts.

Additional details and instructions can be found in the README files under each
exercise. If you have any questions feel free to reach out.

We've also included an empty git repository. Please use git and make commits
throughout working on these exercises so we can track your progress.
